This code has been modified such that the free energy functional becomes dependent on both composition, which will be conserved variable and order parameter, which is an unconserved parameter. 

The elastic constants have been pegged to the order parameter.

Additionally, we can also define eigenstrains for compostion, but in this code, we assume them to be zero.
