	INPUT Files - Description

											************************/

The files 

sustained_noise, 
system_constants, 
ave_comp and
init_comp_prof 

are generated using the preprocessor routines. Of the
above ave_comp and init_compo_prof are binary files and cannot be
edited using the text editors. 

The file sustained_noise contains the following information:
(a) If noise needs to be added (0 if "NO" and 1 if "YES")
(b) If yes, the number steps after which the noise needs to be added
and the magnitude of noise.

The file system_constants contains the following information:
The number of grid points in the x and y directions, the grid length
along the x and y directions, the gradient energy coefficient, the
constant for bulk free energy density, total number of time steps, the
length of each time step, and the number of time steps after which
the data needs to be written.

In addition, the following files may also need to be edited:

(1) problem_type

Indicate if the evolution is diffusional without elasticity (Key: 1),
or evolution with homogeneous elasticity (Key: 2), or inhomogeneous
elasticity (Key: 3)

(2) elastic_constants

Indicate the eigenstrains (eps0_11, eps0_22, and eps0_12) as well as
the elastic constants for the matrix and the precipitate respectively.
(We assume cubic elasticity, and hence c11, c12 and c44 need to be 
indicated). If homogeneous elastic calculations are indicated, then
the elastic constants of the matrix is taken to be the elastic
constant of the system.

(3) applied_stress

Indicate the xx and yy components of the applied stress.

(4) evolution_type

Indicate if it is constrained evoution (Key: 0) or unconstrained
evolution (Key: 1). If it is contrained evolution, the homogeneous
strain is assumed to be zero.

(5) FFTW_option

Indicate the option for FFTW plan:

0 - FFTW_ESTIMATE
1 - FFTW_MEASURE
2 - FFTW_PATIENCE
3 - FFTW_EXHAUSTIVE

The initialisation times increase with increasing numbers, as also the
efficiency. Check the FFTW manual for further details.

(6) interpolator_constants

Indicate the number of entries in the table for the interpolation of
the functions alpha (elastic constant interpolation) and beta
(eigenstrain interpolation), and, the interpolation type. As of now,
the code can handle three types of interpolation:

tanh function (Key: 1)
composition (Key: 2)
composition - average_composition (Key: 3)

(7) magic_numbers

Indicate the maximum number of iterations and error allowed for the
refinement of the displacement solution.
